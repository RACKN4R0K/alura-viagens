This is a project I'm doing together with Alura's course. The project is based on a travel agency where customers will have to fill in the form according to the requested information.
The customer will have to put his zip code, cpf and among other personal information.<br>
This site has some authentications that I'm still improving, such as phone, cpf and email authentications, I know it's not the best way to do this authentication, but through an Api, but as I'm starting now in PHP programming it's already a big step forward for me.

Hope you like it... : )

NOTE: The Project is still under development.
